# Paid Time Off (PTO) & Leave Policy

## 1. Overview
We believe in the importance of rest and relaxation for our employees' well-being. This policy covers vacation, sick leave, and personal time.

## 2. Accrual Schedule
- **Full-Time Employees**: Accrue PTO based on years of service:
    - **0-2 Years**: 15 days per year (1.67 days/month).
    - **3-5 Years**: 20 days per year (2.08 days/month).
    - **5+ Years**: 25 days per year (2.5 days/month).
- **Part-Time Employees**: Accrue PTO on a pro-rata basis.
- **Accrual Cap**: Once an employee reaches 1.5x their annual entitlement, accrual stops until the balance is reduced.

## 3. Requesting PTO
- **Procedure**: All PTO requests must be submitted through the HRIS (Workday/BambooHR) portal.
- **Notice Period**:

    - **Length > 1 week**: Notify manager at least 3 weeks in advance.

## 4. Carry Over and Payout
