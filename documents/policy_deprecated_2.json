Objective and Scope\nThis policy establishes guidelines for employees who work from home (WFH), either on a regular or occasional basis. The company recognizes the benefits of flexible working arrangements in promoting work-life balance, increasing productivity, and reducing environmental impact. This policy applies to all full-time and part-time employees whose job roles are compatible with remote work.\n\n## 2. Eligibility Criteria\nNot all roles are suitable for remote work. Eligibility is determined based on the following factors:\n- **Nature of Work**: The role must allow for duties to be performed effectively outside the office environment without compromising team collaboration or service delivery.\n- **Performance**: Employees must maintain a satisfactory performance rating. Those on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) may not be eligible for WFH.\n- **Tenure**: Generally, new hires may be required to work in the office for an initial probation period (e.g., 3 months) to facilitate onboarding and cultural integration, unless hired as a remote-first employee.\n- **Manager Approval**: All WFH arrangements must be approved in writing by the direct supervisor and Department Head.\n\n## 3. Work Schedules and Availability\n- **Core Hours**: Employees are expected to be available and responsive during core business hours, defined as 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM local time, to ensure overlap for meetings and collaboration.\n- **Flexibility**: Outside of core hours, employees may structure their workday to suit their personal needs, provided they work their contracted number of hours per week.\n- **Responsiveness**: Remote workers must be accessible via email, chat (Slack/Teams), and phone during agreed-upon working hours. Status updates should be set appropriately (e.g., \"In a meeting\", \"at lunch\", \"focus time\").\n\n## 4. Equipment and Workspace\n- **Company Equipment**: The company provides a standard remote work kit, including a high-performance laptop, monitor, keyboard, and mouse.\n- **Stipend**: A one-time Home Office Stipend of $500 is available for eligible employees to purchase an ergonomic chair, desk, or other necessary office supplies. This stipend is taxable.\n- **Workspace Requirements**: Employees are responsible for maintaining a safe, secure, and ergonomic workspace. This includes a stable internet connection (minimum 50 Mbps download / 10 Mbps upload) and a quiet environment free from distractions during meetings.\n- **Technical Support**: IT support is available remotely. Hardware failures may require the employee to ship the device to IT or visit a local authorized service center.\n\n## 5. Security and Confidentiality\n- **Data Privacy**: Employees must adhere to all data protection and confidentiality policies. Company data should never be saved on personal devices or public cloud storage.\n- **Network Security**: Use of the company VPN is mandatory when accessing internal systems from public Wi-Fi networks. Home Wi-Fi networks must be secured with a strong password.\n- **Device Security**: Laptops must be locked when unattended. Lost or stolen equipment must be reported to IT and Security immediately.\n\n## 6. Expenses and Reimbursements\n- **Internet/Phone**: The company does not reimburse standard home internet or phone bills, as these are considered standard household utilities.\n- **Travel**: Trips to the office for required meetings (if the employee is classified as fully remote and lives >50 miles away) will be reimbursed according to the Travel Policy.\n- **Supplies**: Office supplies (notebooks, pens, etc.) can be ordered through the central procurement portal and shipped to the employee's home.\n\n## 7. Health and Safety\n- **Ergonomics**: Employees are encouraged to perform self-assessments of their workstation ergonomics. The Health & Safety team can provide virtual consultations.\n- **Incidents**: Work-related injuries that occur in the designated home workspace during working hours must be reported immediately in accordance with Workers' Compensation laws.\n\n## 8. Termination of Agreement\nThe company reserves the right to terminate or modify WFH arrangements at any time based on business needs or performance issues. Employees may also request to return to the office at any time."
