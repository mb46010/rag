    "content": "# Paid Time Off (PTO) & Leave Policy\n\n## 1. Overview\nWe believe in the importance of rest and relaxation for our employees' well-being. This policy covers vacation, sick leave, and personal time.\n\n## 2. Accrual Schedule\n- **Full-Time Employees**: Accrue PTO based on years of service:\n    - **0-2 Years**: 20 days per year (1.67 days/month).\n    - **3-5 Years**: 25 days per year (2.08 days/month).\n    - **5+ Years**: 30 days per year (2.5 days/month).\n- **Part-Time Employees**: Accrue PTO on a pro-rata basis.\n- **Accrual Cap**: Once an employee reaches 1.5x their annual entitlement, accrual stops until the balance is reduced.\n\n## 3. Requesting PTO\n- **Procedure**: All PTO requests must be submitted through the HRIS (Workday/BambooHR) portal.\n- **Notice Period**:\n    - **Length < 3 days**: Notify manager at least 24 hours in advance.\n    - **Length 3-5 days**: Notify manager at least 1 week in advance.\n    - **Length > 1 week**: Notify manager at least 2 weeks in advance.\n- **Approval**: Managers will approve requests based on team coverage and business needs. During peak periods (e.g., end of quarter), PTO may be restricted.\n\n## 4. Carry Over and Payout\n- **Carry Over**: A maximum of 5 days (40 hours) of unused PTO may be carried over into the next calendar year. Any excess PTO remaining at the end of the year will be forfeited (Use it or lose it), except where prohibited by local law.\n- **Expiration**: Carried-over days must be used by March 31st of the following year.\n- **Separation**: Upon termination of employment (voluntary or involuntary), accrued but unused PTO will be paid out to the employee in their final paycheck, in accordance with state/local laws.\n\n## 5. Sick Leave\n- **Allocation**: Employees are granted 10 days of separate Sick Leave per year. This is not accrued and resets continually every Jan 1st.\n- **Usage**: Can be used for personal illness, medical appointments, or caring for a sick family member.\n- **Doctor's Note**: A doctor's note may be required for sick leave extending beyond 3 consecutive days.\n\n## 6.
